House Rent Prediction
Introduction
This project aims to predict the rent of a housing property using various features such as the number of bedrooms, size, floor, area type, area locality, city, and furnishing status. The goal is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the rent of a house based on these factors.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a housing rental dataset that contains information about various housing properties. The dataset includes the following features:

Posted On: The date when the property was posted for rent.
BHK: The number of bedrooms, hall, and kitchen.
Rent: The rental price of the property.
Size: The size of the property in square feet.
Floor: The floor on which the property is located.
Area Type: The type of area (Super Area, Carpet Area, etc.).
Area Locality: The locality where the property is located.
City: The city where the property is located.
Furnishing Status: The furnishing status of the property (Unfurnished, Semi-Furnished, or Furnished).
Tenant Preferred: The preferred tenant type (Bachelors, Family, etc.).
Bathroom: The number of bathrooms in the property.
Point of Contact: The point of contact for the property (Owner, Agent, etc.).
Methodology
The project follows these steps:

Data Exploration: Analyze the dataset to understand the relationships between the features and the target variable (Rent).
Data Preprocessing: Clean the data, handle missing values, and encode categorical features.
Feature Engineering: Create new features or transform existing features to improve the model's performance.
Model Selection: Try different machine learning algorithms, such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and XGBoost, to find the best-performing model.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the selected model using appropriate metrics, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared.
Model Deployment: Deploy the trained model to a production environment, where it can be used to predict the rent of housing properties.
Usage
To use this project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies (e.g., pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, etc.).
Run the Jupyter Notebook file House Rent Prediction.ipynb to see the implementation and results.
